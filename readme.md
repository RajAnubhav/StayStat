# Business Problem <br>

''' In recent years, City Hotel and resort hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues
    as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates in both hotels'
    is our primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer through business advice to address
    their problem. '''
